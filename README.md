How do I approach designing software?
I'm quite the beginner so I will write out all my ideas on a piece of paper and read the documentation of what I am looking to create in depth.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills I have acquired are to make my code as modular as possible, this helped greatly when debugging issue.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed learnOPENGL almost to the T to make my project work.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In future projects I will ensure my programs have exception handling and modular designs.

How do I approach developing programs?
I write out a sketch on paper before I put it in code

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategy I learned was how to find documentation that is easily digestable to be able to be implemented.

How did iteration factor into your development?
By enabling me to traverse a large dataset without figuring out each specific solution.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has stayed the same use as much time in the beginning of the week to accomplish as much as I can and use the rest of the week to polish.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science serves as an entryway to entry level jobs in IT.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
That difficult courses are not impossible if you dedicate yourself.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
To appreciate the amount of work people go through to design top notch games.
